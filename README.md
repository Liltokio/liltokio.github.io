### CPSC 120A 

* Lab 1 
https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-01-ethan-bryant

    Lab 1, **hello.cc** was one my favorite labs because I was able to create my first ever code project, aswell as get to learn the ropes of VSC, this lab helped me understand the *std::cout* information aspect of the language.

* Lab 7
https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-07-bryant-kristine

    Lab 7, part 1 was a very difficult but yet promising lab for myself, it was a mini game which required the user to input a "guess" of a number, then it prompted the secondary user to input their guess, the reason I placed this lab here is because it allowed me to understand how the **"make"** file works, aswell as allowed me to impliment and improve on my ability to create arguments within the program. as well as the use of **"if"**.

* Lab 10
https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-ethan-jacob-bryant

    Lab 10, part 1 was a awesome lab which implimented the use of functions and all the past factors which we used during labs 4-9, the use of *"strings, vectors, arguments and the int"* processes in order to calibrate each described factor really helped me improve my ability to code. Similarly, it helped get me comfurtable with working in multiple files rather then just 1. This helped me figure out how to impliment the needed program in order to make the machine run smooth.
